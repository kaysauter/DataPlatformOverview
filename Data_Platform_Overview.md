## Motivation

I vividly remember my very first time years ago when I had to explain a relatively simple business intelligence architecture to some people who never have heard of such architecture before. I've left them confused. Well, I can't blame them for I was talking with too many acronyms like SSAS, SSIS, SSMS, SSRS! During my career, I've learned a lot on how to explain this, but that is still no easy task if you're talking to people who are not familiar with the data world. And because Microsofts data platform family is still growing, this problem doesn't get any easier.

Unfortunately, even though I am very happy with Microsoft's documentation about their data stack, I am yet to find a good overview of all Data Platform Tools which you do not have to click through tons of links. Such one single site would help to get just an overview of the tools and tell concepts to people who are new to this topic.

This is what I aim to do with this post, a simple overview of all tools by Microsoft that somehow are related to the Data Platform Stack. I will focus on software by Microsoft only. Still, because this already contains so many tools, I will probably miss some. If you spot one or you believe that something is wrong, please drop a line in the comments! I will add or correct it and credit you! I also will try to maintain the links and add new tools by Microsoft. This page is also available on Github, so you may create a PR there as well.
